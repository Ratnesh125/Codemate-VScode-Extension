# Codemate - Visual Studio Code Extension

Codemate is a Visual Studio Code extension that integrates a minimal chat interface with the ability to converse with a language model, such as OpenAI's API. It enables users to ask questions, which are then converted into appropriate commands using natural language processing (NLP) and prompt engineering techniques. The responses generated by the model are displayed within the chat interface integrated with terminal, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration while coding.
